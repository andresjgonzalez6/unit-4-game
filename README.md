# unit-4-game

    //Anything after line 33 does not work for some reason, I am not sure. The console.log are not functioning. Most problematic, the crystal buttons are unresponsive. Once the buttons start to work, the rest of the game should work. 

    I intended to complete the JS first and move to the CSS to make it prettier. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the JS to work properly. 

    NOTES: This game is intended to show my understanding in JavaScript and jQuery.
